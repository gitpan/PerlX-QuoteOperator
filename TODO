* parser flag   (  -parser => 1  )

  This invokes the optional "heath robinson" parser!  
  
  This can be useful for qw// in some cases but generally you should be able to live without it.
    
  
  So at moment the -parser issues are:
  
  - Only parses single line.  So multi-line quote operator will fail with { -parser => 1 } is set
  
  - And delimiters must match exactly.. so for eg.  qw// & qw!!     qw{}, qw() & qw[] not implemented (yet)
  
  See examples/qw.pl  for examples of some of the issues
  

* Some more Quote Like Operator Modules:

  - List comprehension / maker 
  
  - JSON to Perl hashref (and visa versa)
  
  - List to Hash
  
  - DateTime
  
  - SQL
  
  - Return object (to test)

* Added import checks on parameters

* Bit about API for building new quote operators (for now just look at URL.pm)
